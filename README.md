# Expected-xG-Goals-Football


## What is xG?

Put simply, Expected Goals (xG) is a metric designed to measure the probability of a shot resulting in a goal. An xG model uses historical information from thousands of shots with similar characteristics to estimate the likelihood of a goal on a scale between 0 and 1. For example, a shot with an xG value of 0.2 is one that we would generally expect to be converted twice in every 10 attempts. But that's just the start of it. Read on for a guide to understanding one of the most common advanced metrics in soccer.


Through this attempt I have tried to create an expected goals model to understand the quality of the football shots by football players who played for F.C. Barcelona.
